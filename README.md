# **Brief description about the topic**
Qatar's economic growth strategy aims to diversify its income sources, and tourism is a key part of that plan. The country is actively attracting visitors with a focus on both modern attractions and its cultural heritage.  Their tourism strategy includes making it easier to visit with relaxed visa requirements and a variety of accommodation options.  This focus on tourism is paying off as Qatar was named the Arab Tourism Capital for 2023 and is investing heavily in hotels, museums, and other infrastructure to meet its ambitious goal of attracting 6 million visitors a year by 2030. Investors are encouraged to join this growing market with a streamlined licensing process and other incentives.
